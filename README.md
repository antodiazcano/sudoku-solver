This repo contains the code to solve any sudoku using **backtrack** algorithm. In each iteration it expands all new possible games until there are no empty cells.

***sudoku.py*** is the class for a sudoku game, ***backtrack.py*** the code of the algorithm and in ***examples.py*** there are some examples of games. Specifically, in this last file there is a normal sudoku, a very difficult sudoku and what is known as the most difficult sudoku in the world (this last one may take up to 2 minutes).
